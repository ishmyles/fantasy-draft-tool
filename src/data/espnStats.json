He is an elite prospect in both points and category leagues.

VanVleet also provided strong category value with 3.1 3PG, 1.4 SPG, and even a surprising 0.8 BPG at only 6-feet tall. There are signs that VanVleet could be due for a smaller role this season, though. The Rockets chose highly regarded combo guard Reed Sheppard with the third overall pick in this summer's draft, and he could eat into VanVleet's role. Also, big picture, the Rockets start three players aged 22 or less, have another 21 year old ready for big minutes in last season's fourth overall pick Amen Thompson, and now Reed on deck. The 30-something VanVleet could eventually end up ceding time to younger teammates.

Because he's a more natural power forward than Towns, Randle should actually fit better in the Timberwolves lineup next to Rudy Gobert than Towns did.

This season, Bridges likely returns to more of a Suns-like role for his new team, the Knicks.

Williamson will look to bounce-back on the production front this season, and the fact that he'll get to play with a legitimate, All-Star point guard in Dejounte Murray could play a part in that. Murray should be able to get Williamson the ball in spots that he prefers, at times when the defense is more imbalanced having to account for the other Pelicans scoring threats.

With better lead guard play this season, from both Chris Paul and rookie Stephon Castle, Vassell should see even more good looks and have a chance for the best scoring season of his career.

Also, since the 2021-22 season, only Dejounte Murray has more steals than Jones. Last season, he showcased an improved offensive game, shooting an impressive 49.8% from the floor. Jones excels defensively, which allows him to log significant minutes on the court.

This feels like a make-or-break season for Ivey, especially with a new coaching staff.

Edey will likely be the fourth or fifth scoring option behind Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. But Morant's drives could open up lob opportunities for the rookie and their pick-and-roll game has a chance to be effective early on as well, with Edey’s size making him a great screener."},{"id":128,"name":"Kelly Oubre Jr.","team":"76ers","position":"SF, SG","statsLastSeason":{"gp":"68","mins":"30.3","fg":".441","ft":".750","3pm":"1.5","rebs":"5.0","ast":"1.5","assistTO":"1.16","stl":"1.1","blk":"0.7","to":"1.3","pts":"15.4"},"statsPrediction":{"gp":"70","mins":"30.8","fg":".440","ft":".751","3pm":"1.6","reb":"5.1","ast":"1.5","assistTO":"1.15","stl":"1.2","blk":"0.7","to":"1.3","pts":"15.9"},"playerOutlook":"Oubre Jr. exceeded expectations during his one-year deal with the 76ers.

With Dejounte Murray, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram and CJ McCollum all in the mix, his fantasy ceiling could be capped.

He’s had a big offseason, focusing on building strength, filling in his frame and preparing for a larger role this season.

Our projections suggest Sharpe will maintain similar per-game averages this season. While he’ll likely come off the bench due to Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons and Deni Avdija being on the team, Sharpe’s appeal remains high once he's able to return to the court -- likely in mid-November -- from a shoulder injury sustained in early October."},{"id":136,"name":"Brandin Podziemski","team":"Warriors","position":"SG","statsLastSeason":{"gp":"74","mins":"26.6","fg":".454","ft":".633","3pm":"1.2","rebs":"5.8","ast":"3.7","assistTO":"3.10","stl":"0.8","blk":"0.2","to":"1.2","pts":"9.2"},"statsPrediction":{"gp":"75","mins":"29.3","fg":".466","ft":".656","3pm":"1.4","reb":"6.4","ast":"4.1","assistTO":"3.14","stl":"0.9","blk":"0.4","to":"1.3","pts":"10.5"},"playerOutlook":"What makes Podziemski an intriguing late-round target is the opportunity to step into the starting shooting guard role after Klay Thompson's departure.

With the Cavaliers returning their core group, Strus is projected to maintain similar per-game averages this upcoming season and should have a comparable role to last year.

His production matched his career averages, and he's projected for similar numbers this year.

Still, in the last 18 games of last season, he averaged 22.7 PPG and 12.5 RPG, so not all hope is lost. If you can handle his ups and downs, these are the stats you could see from him in fantasy.
